### End-to-end Temporal Relation Extraction in the clinical domain as a sequence-to-sequence task with the REBEL framework

This repository contains the code for the modelling and evaluation of our BART-based model that is capable of performing end-to-end temporal relation extraction in clinical narratives as a sequence-to-sequence task. This work was presented in Text2Story 2023.

The pre-trained model and part of the code are based on the REBEL framework (Cabot, 2021). The corpus was retrieved from the i2b2 2012 Temporal Relation Task (Sun, 2013).
